	idea: run catboost on inital data set to get a benchmark
	notes:

try this
drop old data:
	idea: drop data from a long time ago
	notes: the model / feature enginering might do this anyway
	result:

try this
validation:
	idea: create a validation sample
	notes: For N months, select M as initial training set, validated on M+1'th month, then M+=1, repeat 
	result:

remove outliers
	idea: remove outliers
	notes: the clipping that mimics competition guidelines took care of outliers
	result:done, (i clipped sales values)



check leak:
	idea: check test subset to see if its accosiated with any other vars
	notes:
		-eda/check_test_sampling.R
		-dataset too large, try aggregating first, did this
	result: no obvious relationship between sales and inclusion of item/shop combo in test set


aggregate:
	idea: aggregate train data to make it compatible with test
	notes: need to also clip sales values between [0,20]
	result: aggregation script is preproc/aggregate.R
stitch:
	idea: merge input data
	notes; drop rows with Nas generated by merging, these contain only items
	result: done, in preproc/stitch.R
